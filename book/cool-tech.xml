	<title>The Real Content</title>

	<para>
Middle chapters talk about the stuff the book's really supposed to be
about.  This one is all about "Cool-Tech", which is both Cool and
Technical.  And since this is a Nutshell book, it is a comprehesive
reference to all of the coolness.

Even though this is a technical reference, there were a few little
details that were to complicated or inconsequential to include in one
of the real chapters.  So they're here, in a chapter that clearly
indicates that it doesn't have to be read.
